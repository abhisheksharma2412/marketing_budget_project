**Optimizing Marketing Campaign Budgets Across Multiple Marketing Platforms Using Machine Learning**

The allocation of the marketing budget is one important discipline to achieve the best possible return on investment (ROI) in the changing market environment today. Traditional methods work by employing fixed heuristics or historical performance, and are often unable to respond to rapidly changing consumer behaviors. This research develops a machine learning framework to model campaign ROI and optimal budget allocation across multiple marketing channels. This study uses a set of 200,000 campaigns it collects from five different companies. Together, this involved advanced feature engineering, such as ratio features, temporal variables, and interaction terms, and the use of Azure ML Studioâ€™s AutoML to select and tune the models. While the final performance metrics should be ready soon, initial work certainly highlights a method that has likely brought increased prediction power and support for allocation decisions
